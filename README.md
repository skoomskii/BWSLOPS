# BWSLOPS

BWSLOPS is a prototype web-based application aiming to reduce paper-waste and optimise operations at the Blue Waters Saint Lucia Limited Plant facility. It was designed to be a flexible platform built on the MERN stack for use on company devices. This iteration allows logged-in users to create, delete and recycle QR codes. Each QR code is internal, distinct and can be tied to a digital form. Both guest and logged-in users can create and search for forms by scanning the codes. Future iterations can have expanded features with ease.
